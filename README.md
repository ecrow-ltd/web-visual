## Getting Started

Clone the repository with SSH or HTTPS.

``` bash
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:ecrow-ltd/web-visual.git

# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/ecrow-ltd/web-visual.git
```

Navitate in the directory of the newly clone repository using NPM or Yarn.

``` bash
cd web-visual

# NPM
npm install

# Yarn
yarn install
```

## Running the Application

Running the application is easy after completing the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section. Simply run the following command from within the web-visual directory:

``` bash
yarn start
```

After a bit of time, a server will be started along with a clickable URL in the terminal.

The URL is `http://localhost:2769` or `http://127.0.0.1:2769` on the same system that `yarn start` was executed.
